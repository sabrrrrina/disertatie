  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>What does this extension do?</h2>
      <p>It automatically detects and rejects cookie consent banners on websites, helping you navigate with fewer interruptions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What does "Pages Handled" mean in Statistics?</h2>
      <p>It’s the number of unique pages where the extension has successfully rejected a cookie banner, <strong>not</strong> the number of individual cookies removed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is the Whitelist?</h2>
      <p>The whitelist is a list of sites where the extension will not try to reject cookies. You can add a site to the whitelist if you want to manage cookies manually on that site.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The extension broke a page. What now?</h2>
      <p>Some sites load content dynamically, and occasionally the extension’s automatic click may remove more than just the cookie banner (for example, on Pinterest). If this happens, simply add the domain to the whitelist — the page will load normally after that.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Does this block tracking cookies?</h2>
      <p>No — it only dismisses consent banners. For full tracker blocking, you’ll need a content blocker or privacy-focused browser.</p>
