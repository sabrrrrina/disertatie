  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>What does this extension do?</h2>
      <p>It automatically detects and rejects cookie consent banners on websites, helping you navigate with fewer interruptions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What does "Pages Handled" mean in Statistics?</h2>
      <p>It’s the number of unique pages where the extension has successfully rejected a cookie banner, <strong>not</strong> the number of individual cookies removed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is the Whitelist?</h2>
      <p>The whitelist is a list of sites where the extension will not try to reject cookies. You can add a site to the whitelist if you want to manage cookies manually on that site.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The extension broke a page. What now?</h2>
      <p>Some sites load content dynamically, and occasionally the extension’s automatic click may remove more than just the cookie banner (for example, on Pinterest). If this happens, simply add the domain to the whitelist — the page will load normally after that.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Does this block tracking cookies?</h2>
      <p>No — it only dismisses consent banners. For full tracker blocking, you’ll need a content blocker or privacy-focused browser.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What does the "Retry" button do?</h2>
      <p>If the cookie banner wasn’t removed the first time, you can click <em>Retry</em> to run the detection again without reloading the page. Mainly used for pages where the cookie banners loads late.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is "Debug" for?</h2>
      <p>The <em>Debug</em> button is used for troubleshooting to report the extension did not work on that specific page.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is "Page Info"?</h2>
      <p>The <em>Page Info</em> feature uses an AI helper to summarize the current page or highlight relevant details. Think of it as a quick overview of the page content.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What does "Delete All" do?</h2>
      <p>Clicking <em>Delete All</em> will remove all saved cookie decisions and clear your whitelist. It will also clear the browser cookie storage. Use this if you want a fresh start.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is "Block Content"?</h2>
      <p>This feature lets you blur out unwanted categories of content (like violence, hate speech, gambling, or drugs/alcohol) on websites. 
      The rules apply across sessions, and you can enable or disable categories anytime in the popup.</p>
